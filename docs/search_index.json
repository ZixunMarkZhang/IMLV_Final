It contains the costumer of bank client. The feature contains as follows: 1 - age (numeric) 2 - job : type of job (categorical: ‘admin.’,‘blue-collar’,‘entrepreneur’,‘housemaid’,‘management’,‘retired’,‘self-employed’,‘services’,‘student’,‘technician’,‘unemployed’,‘unknown’) 3 - marital : marital status (categorical: ‘divorced’,‘married’,‘single’,‘unknown’; note: ‘divorced’ means divorced or widowed) 4 - education (categorical: ‘basic.4y’,‘basic.6y’,‘basic.9y’,‘high.school’,‘illiterate’,‘professional.course’,‘university.degree’,‘unknown’) 5 - default: has credit in default? (categorical: ‘no’,‘yes’,‘unknown’) 6 - housing: has housing loan? (categorical: ‘no’,‘yes’,‘unknown’) 7 - loan: has personal loan? (categorical: ‘no’,‘yes’,‘unknown’) # related with the last contact of the current campaign: 8 - contact: contact communication type (categorical: ‘cellular’,‘telephone’) 9 - month: last contact month of year (categorical: ‘jan’, ‘feb’, ‘mar’, ..., ‘nov’, ‘dec’) 10 - day_of_week: last contact day of the week (categorical: ‘mon’,‘tue’,‘wed’,‘thu’,‘fri’) 11 - duration: last contact duration, in seconds (numeric). Important note: this attribute highly affects the output target (e.g., if duration=0 then y=‘no’). Yet, the duration is not known before a call is performed. Also, after the end of the call y is obviously known. Thus, this input should only be included for benchmark purposes and should be discarded if the intention is to have a realistic predictive model. # other attributes: 12 - campaign: number of contacts performed during this campaign and for this client (numeric, includes last contact) 13 - pdays: number of days that passed by after the client was last contacted from a previous campaign (numeric; 999 means client was not previously contacted) 14 - previous: number of contacts performed before this campaign and for this client (numeric) 15 - poutcome: outcome of the previous marketing campaign (categorical: ‘failure’,‘nonexistent’,‘success’) # social and economic context attributes 16 - emp.var.rate: employment variation rate - quarterly indicator (numeric) 17 - cons.price.idx: consumer price index - monthly indicator (numeric) 18 - cons.conf.idx: consumer confidence index - monthly indicator (numeric) 19 - euribor3m: euribor 3 month rate - daily indicator (numeric) 20 - nr.employed: number of employees - quarterly indicator (numeric) The label of this data set to predict is a binary variable whether the customer subscribed a term deposit. The features will be preprocessed at the beginning of the project. The categorical data will be encoded by one hot encoder. The numerical data will be normalized if it significantly different mean and standard deviation. Modeling Goal Generate a predictive model by which we get specific information of a client and predict if the client subscribed a term deposit. In real world context, this helps the banks to identify the potential client of term deposit service when they utilize the model on customer information. Methodology Various classification methods will be deployed in this projects including logistic regression, decision tree, and random forest. The introduction of each model are shown as follow: 3.1 Logistic regression Logistic regression is a linear classification model where the log odd is predicted by a linear function with the features. Feature selection according to importance and conduct hypothesis test on coefficient are necessary as there might be feature which has minor effect on the labels. 3.2 Decision Tree Decision tree will build a model where the nodes splits by calculating the cutoff with minimum the gini index, and the tree stops generating at gini index reaches 0 at each nodes. After the tree is built, we may access it to make classification predictions. Even if overfitting is likely to happen, we may address this by prune the tree. 3.3 Random Forest Random forest is a model where the classification decision is made according to most common decision tree result in a number of random generated decision trees. This model is also likely to have overfitting. Hyperparameter tuning will be deployed to ensure there is no overfitting. After the models are built, the optimal thresholds will be selected for each model according to context requirement such as high specificity or high sensitivity. The evaluation of the models is not only seeking for accuracy but also interpretability. Visualization tools such as confusion matrix, ROC curve, and feature importance plot will be deployed in the project to ensure the models are understandable and reproducible. At the end of this project, the model selection will be based on not only numerical metrics such as accuracy or loss but also visualized metrics such as feature importance plot and ROC curve to ensure interpretability, acceptable model complexity, and preciseness.

The plot above is a bar plot showing the counts of the response variables y, defined by whether the person has term deposit. It is quite obvious that there are more cases with y equal to no than ones with y equal to yes. However, considering the number of cases included, we do not have to do any sampling or weight adjustment to the data. To begin with, if we take all the numerical data as a whole, we may want to examine if multicolinearity exists in this data. The plot above shows the correlation matrix of all numerical models. From the plot above, we identify that the correlation are high among nr.employed, emp.var.rate, and euribor3m. The coreelation between cons.price.idx and emp.var.rate is also high. Hence we may drop nr.employed and emp.var.rate to avoid the problem of multicolinearity at the moment. In the section below, we will take a look of each variable and examine if there are any explicit pattern showing correlation between variables and the target variable. 1 - age (numeric). After scaling the age variables, I plot a overlapped numerical histogram showing distribution of age for each y category as shown below. However, there is no obvious difference in pattern of two different categories. 2 - job : type of job (categorical: ‘admin.’, ‘bluecollar’, ‘entrepreneur’, ‘housemaid’, ‘management’, ‘retired’, ‘self-employed’, ‘services’, ‘student’, ‘technician’, ‘unemployed’, ‘unknown’). The plot shown as follow indicates the distribution of yes and no among all the categories. There is no obvious pattern observed from the plot. We may examine the specific impact to the target variable of falling into each category in the following models. 3 - marital : marital status (categorical: ‘divorced’,‘married’,‘single’,‘unknown’; note: ‘divorced’ means divorced or widowed). The plot shown as follow indicates the distribution of yes and no among all the categories. There is no obvious pattern observed from the plot. We may examine the specific impact to the target variable of falling into each category in the following models. 4 - education (categorical: ‘basic.4y’,‘basic.6y’,‘basic.9y’,‘high.school’,‘illiterate’,‘professional.course’,‘university.degree’,‘unknown’). The plot shown as follow indicates the distribution of yes and no among all the categories. There is no obvious pattern observed from the plot. We may examine the specific impact to the target variable of falling into each category in the following models. 5 - default: has credit in default? (categorical: ‘no’,‘yes’,‘unknown’). The plot shown as follow indicates the distribution of yes and no among all the categories. There is no obvious pattern observed from the plot. We may examine the specific impact to the target variable of falling into each category in the following models. 6 - housing: has housing loan? (categorical: ‘no’,‘yes’,‘unknown’). The plot shown as follow indicates the distribution of yes and no among all the categories. There is no obvious pattern observed from the plot. We may examine the specific impact to the target variable of falling into each category in the following models. 7 - loan: has personal loan? (categorical: ‘no’,‘yes’,‘unknown’). The plot shown as follow indicates the distribution of yes and no among all the categories. There is no obvious pattern observed from the plot. We may examine the specific impact to the target variable of falling into each category in the following models. # related with the last contact of the current campaign: 8 - contact: contact communication type (categorical: ‘cellular’,‘telephone’). The plot shown as follow indicates the distribution of yes and no among all the categories. There is no obvious pattern observed from the plot. We may examine the specific impact to the target variable of falling into each category in the following models. # other attributes: 12 - campaign: number of contacts performed during this campaign and for this client (numeric, includes last contact). After scaling the campaign variables, I plot a overlapped numerical histogram showing distribution of campaign for each y category as shown below. However, there is no obvious difference in pattern of two different categories. 13 - pdays: number of days that passed by after the client was last contacted from a previous campaign (numeric; 999 means client was not previously contacted). After scaling the pdays variables, I plot a overlapped numerical histogram showing distribution of age for each y category as shown below. It is worth noticing that when the scaled pdays is negative, the proportion of client with term deposit largely increases. This is a indication of influential variable. 14 - previous: number of contacts performed before this campaign and for this client (numeric). After scaling the previous variables, I plot a overlapped numerical histogram showing distribution of previous for each y category as shown below. However, there is no obvious difference in pattern of two different categories. 15 - poutcome: outcome of the previous marketing campaign (categorical: ‘failure’,‘nonexistent’,‘success’). The plot shown as follow indicates the distribution of yes and no among all the categories. It is quite obvious that the proportion of having term deposit is much higher for those client has successful previous campaigns. # social and economic context attributes 17 - cons.price.idx: consumer price index - monthly indicator (numeric). This variable is renamed as priceIndex for the following analysis. After scaling the priceIndex variables, I plot a overlapped numerical histogram showing distribution of priceIndex for each y category as shown below. It is worth noticing that when the scaled priceIndex is smaller than -1 or larger than 2, the proportion of client with term deposit largely increases. This is a indication of influential variable. 18 - cons.conf.idx: consumer confidence index - monthly indicator (numeric). This variable is renamed as confidenceIndex for the following analysis. After scaling the confidenceIndex variables, I plot a overlapped numerical histogram showing distribution of confidenceIndex for each y category as shown below. It is worth noticing that when the scaled confidenceIndex is smaller than -1.5 or larger than 1, the proportion of client with term deposit largely increases. This is a indication of influential variable. 19 - euribor3m: Euro Interbank Offered Rate 3 month rate - daily indicator (numeric). This variable is renamed as InterestRateindex for the following analysis. After scaling the InterestRateindex variables, I plot a overlapped numerical histogram showing distribution of InterestRateindex for each y category as shown below. It is worth noticing that when the scaled interestRateIndex is smaller than -1.2 , the proportion of client with term deposit largely increases. This is a indication of influential variable.
